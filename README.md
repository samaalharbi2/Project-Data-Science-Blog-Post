## 🎯 Project Motivation

Why do some developers seem to land jobs faster, earn more, or thrive in diverse tech stacks?  
This project aims to explore trends in developer behavior, education, and technology usage to answer questions like:
- How does education affect job search efficiency?
- Which programming languages dominate the industry?
- What does the salary distribution tell us about developer value?

With data from over 80,000 developers worldwide, the goal is to extract actionable insights and uncover patterns that can empower aspiring and current developers to make informed career decisions.

## 🔬 Methodology

Our analysis follows the **CRISP-DM** process:

1. **Business Understanding** – Identify the purpose and value of the data.  
2. **Data Understanding** – Load, explore, and summarize the data.  
3. **Data Preparation** – Clean missing values, transform features.  
4. **Modeling** – Train ML models where needed.  
5. **Evaluation** – Assess insights/statistics and model performance.  
6. **Deployment** – Share findings through visuals and blog storytelling.

The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between raw survey data and career-changing insights. We seek to understand how variables such as education, programming languages, and job search behavior influence salary and job outcomes. These findings are crucial for stakeholders such as:

- **Hiring Managers** – To understand talent behavior trends.  
- **Developers** – To adjust skills and strategies.  
- **Educators** – To tailor tech education programs.  
- **Career Coaches** – To guide job seekers based on data.
